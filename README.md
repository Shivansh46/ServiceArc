## How to Set Up & Run 🔧

1. **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shivansh46/ServiceArc.git
    cd ServiceArc
    ```

2. **Setup a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

    This ensures that the dependencies of the project do not interfere with your global Python setup.

    ```bash
    python -m venv servicearc_env
    source servicearc_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `servicearc_env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies:**

    Make sure you have pip installed. Then, run:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    > Note: Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` in your repository with all necessary Python packages listed.

4. **Setting up the Web Server:**

    If you're using a framework or any server for your application, you'd have instructions to start it here. For instance, if you're using Flask:

    ```bash
    export FLASK_APP=app.py  # On Windows, use `set FLASK_APP=app.py`
    flask run
    ```

    Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to view the application.

5. **Using the Machine Learning Models:**

    Detailed instructions on how to train or use your pre-trained models for vehicle prediction and count estimation.

6. **Frontend Setup:**

    If there's any additional setup for your frontend, describe it here. For instance, if you have a frontend dev server:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

7. **Testing:**

    Instructions for running tests if any are included:

    ```bash
    python -m unittest discover -s tests
    ```

8. **Deactivate Virtual Environment:**

    Once you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```
